DEAD BROKE

DEAD BROKE is a game where everything and everyone is broken. You only weapon is a pistol that breaks after one use, your only strategy is to break the lights and hug the darkness, and your only goal is to finally fix everything. DEAD BROKE combines top-down shooter mechanics with puzzles where you must strategically break lights, stay in darkness, and use your single-use weapon to ascend to the next floor.
MOVEMENT

GAMEPLAY

    The gun can be used twice; once with the bullet when firing, and also when thrown. You can use it to kill enemies.
    Avoid the detection cones of the enemies by staying out of their way, killing those in the path, or turning off the lights; they can only see you when you are well-lit.
